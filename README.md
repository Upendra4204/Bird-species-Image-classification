Over view 

This project utilizes machine learning to predict outcomes based on image inputs. It includes multiple pre-trained models (model77.h5, model86.h5, model92.h5) and a Python-based web application to allow easy user interaction and predictions.

Technologies used:

Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Flask (for web application)

Features

Multiple pre-trained models for accurate predictions.
Web application to upload images and get predictions.
Organized directories for training, validation, and testing datasets.

Installation

git clone https://github.com/Upendra4204/Bird-species-Image-classification.git
cd Bird-species-Image-classification  
python app.py

Usage

Start the web application by running app.py.
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Upload an image using the interface and get predictions based on the trained models.
